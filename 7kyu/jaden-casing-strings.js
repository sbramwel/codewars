// Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. 
// The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.
// Example:
// Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
// Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"

// My solution
String.prototype.toJadenCase = function () {
    const words = this.split(" ");
    for (let i = 0; i < words.length;i++) {
      words[i] = words[i][0].toUpperCase() + words[i].slice(1);
    }
     return words.join(" ")
  };
